            <h1>My Bio</h1>
            <p class='allinfo'>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings, my name is Nayan Patel, and as a Early College student, I hope 
                to accomplish a lot for my future. Firstly, I would like to learn many programming and markdown languages 
                before I graduate highschool. As of now, I know Python very well and have some experience with CSS and HTML. 
                I also plan on using my experience with coding for projects I am currently working on. For example,
                in my school we have a club called RSA. This club is a app building competition where students can use their technical
                abilities to use in this competition. I hope to accomplish the feat of winning this competition with my fellow groupmates. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, I would like to be either an Engineer or a Software Developer. I am very interested on how GPUs and CPUs
                are made and what kind of research they require to get them working. Moreover, my dream job is Nvidia, one of the biggest GPU and CPU 
                creators in the world. Before I get there, I need to get my education in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After highschool, I would like to attend Georgia Tech or NC State. Here, there are many opportunities that would help
                me reach my end goal of becoming a software developer. Even here at WECIB, we get to learn 5 programming and markdown languages, meaning
                we will be ahead of the curve. We get to learn Java, Javascript, Python, HTML, and CSS. These are my plans for the next several years of my life.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had created a database including all the Colleges median GPA and SAT scores. 
                    Once they input their info, it searches the database using pandas and gives you the colleges you fit the most.
                </p>
                <li class='plist'>Magic 8ball Game</li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was made in my Python 1 class when working on dictionaries. I made a long list of dictionaries and once the person 
                    inputs the key, it takes the message out of the dictionary and output it into the console. 
                </p>
                <li class='plist'>Godot Game Project</li>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had made a Godot Game using GD_Script. This included animations, controls, graphics, logic, and more.
