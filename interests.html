           <li class = 'intlist'> Volleyball</li>
            <p class = 'intlist'>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had first started playing volleyball around last summer. I played with my friends all day long and eventually
            got a lot better. Now, I play it atleast 3 times a week, where we go to a court and stay they for a couple of hours. 
           <li class = 'intlist'> Games</li>
           <p class = 'intlist'>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a kid, I always grew up playing Nintendo games. My love for games grew with Mario and Zelda, which got me
            into other games such as God of War and others. In the future, I hope to buy a PC in order to continue my hobby of games. 
           </p>
           <li class = 'intlist'> Tabla </li>
           <p class = 'intlist'>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I play an Indian Classical Instrument called the tabla. This is a two handed drum instrument including a base and the main drum. Together, they accompany music and dances in the Indian classical world. 
           </p>
           <li class = 'intlist'> Dogs </li>
           <p class = 'intlist'>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a dog named Lemon a couple years ago. Unfortunately, she did pass away, but her memory still lives today
            through our NOS and CTI classes. She was a beagle, and in the future I do hope to be a proud owner of a dog. 
           </p>
           <li class = 'intlist'> Eating </li>
           <p class = 'intlist'>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do enjoy eating with my friends and family. Around every two weeks, my family and I go to a different restaurant and try out different cuisines. So far, we like 
            Mi Cancun the best because of the speed and quality.
